# Employee Retention Analysis

## Overview
The **Employee Retention Analysis** project focuses on understanding employee attrition trends within an organization. Using Python, this project explores key factors contributing to employee turnover, identifies high-risk areas, and provides insights for improving employee retention.

The project leverages:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Objectives
- Analyze employee attrition rates by department, tenure, and other factors.
- Identify patterns and trends that may indicate causes of employee turnover.
- Create visualizations to present the findings clearly and effectively.
